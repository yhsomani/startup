**5. Create Foundational Legal Documents**

#### A. Operating Agreement (LLC) or Bylaws (C-Corp)

**Operating Agreement (LLC):**
Defines internal operations, ownership, and decision-making.

**Key Sections:**
- Members and ownership percentages
- Voting rights
- Profit distributions
- Management structure (member-managed vs manager-managed)
- Transfer of ownership restrictions
- Dissolution terms

**Bylaws (C-Corp):**
Internal rules governing the corporation.

**Key Sections:**
- Shareholder meetings (annual meeting requirements)

- Officers (CEO, CFO, Secretary roles)
- Stock issuance procedures
- Amendment procedures

**Where to Get:**
- Included with Stripe Atlas or Clerky
- Templates from SCORE or Rocket Lawyer
- Lawyer-drafted (best for complex situations)

---

#### B. Founder Agreement

**Purpose:** Prevent co-founder disputes - the #1 internal startup killer

**Critical Elements:**

```
Founder A: 50%
Founder B: 30%
Founder C: 20%
```

**Vesting Schedule:**
- 4-year vest with 1-year cliff (standard)
- Why: Protects company if someone leaves early

**2. Roles and Responsibilities**
- Who is CEO, CTO, COO, etc.?
- What are each person's primary responsibilities?
- Who has final say on what decisions?

**3. Decision-Making**
- What requires unanimous consent? (Raising money, selling company, bringing on co-founder)
- What requires majority? (Hiring, spending over $X)
- Who breaks ties?

**4. IP Assignment**
- All IP created by founders belongs to company
- Include "prior inventions" list (anything you created before company)

**5. Time Commitment**
- Full-time or part-time?
- What happens if someone wants to leave?
- Non-compete and non-solicit clauses (if enforceable in your state)

**6. Departure **
- Voluntary departure: unvested equity forfeited
- Termination for cause: all equity forfeited
- Company buyback of vested shares (at what price?)

**7. Dispute Resolution**
- Mediation first
- Arbitration if mediation fails
- Which state's laws govern

**Template Resources:**
- Founder Institute FAST Agreement
- YC founder agreement template
- Clerky
- Startup lawyer ($1,500-$3,000 for custom)

**⚠️ Critical:** Sign this BEFORE you start working together!

#### C. Stock Purchase Agreement / 83(b) Election

**For C-Corp Founders:**

**Stock Purchase Agreement:**
- Document showing founder purchased shares
- Usually at $0.0001/share (nominal price)
- Subject to vesting

**83(b) Election:**
- Tax form filed with IRS within 30 days of stock grant
- Elects to pay taxes NOW on current value (minimal) rather than later when company is worth more
- **Critical:** Missing 30-day deadline = potentially huge tax bill later

**Example:**
```
Without 83(b): If your unvested stock is worth $1M when it vests, you owe taxes on $1M income
With 83(b): You paid taxes on $100 value at grant, no tax when it vests, only pay capital gains on growth when you sell
```

**How to File:**
1. Fill out 83(b) election form
2. Mail to IRS (certified mail, keep receipt)
3. Include copy with your tax return
4. **Deadline:** 30 days from stock grant

- First fundraise: Mandatory ($5,000-$15,000)
- First employee: Optional (can use templates)
- Serious legal issue: Mandatory

**How to Find:**

- **Retainer:** Monthly fee for ongoing access

### 2. Use Standard Documents When Possible

Don't reinvent the wheel:
- YC SAFE templates
- Series Seed documents
- NVCA document templates
- Orrick startup forms library

**Why:** VCs and lawyers are familiar with standard docs = faster, cheaper closings

### 3. Actually Read Contracts

Before signing anything:
- [ ] Read it entirely
- [ ] Understand key terms
- [ ] Red-flag items (non-compete, exclusivity, auto-renewal)
- [ ] Negotiate if needed
- [ ] Get lawyer review if high-stakes

### 4. Document Everything

Use DocuSign, HelloSign, or Adobe Sign for:
- Audit trail
- Legal validity
- Organization
- Remote signing

### 5. Regular Legal Checkups

**Annually Review:**
- Corporate governance (board meetings, consents)
- Stock option grants properly documented
- IP assignments from all employees/contractors
- Customer contracts up-to-date
- Compliance with new laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
