#### Detailed Valuation Methods for India

**Method 1: Comparable Company Analysis**
```
Find 3 Indian SaaS companies at similar stage:
- Company A: ₹2Cr ARR, valued at ₹20Cr (10x ARR)
- Company B: ₹1.5Cr ARR, valued at ₹12Cr (8x ARR)
- Company C: ₹2.5Cr ARR, valued at ₹30Cr (12x ARR)

Average multiple: 10x ARR

Your company: ₹1Cr ARR × 10x = ₹10Cr pre-money valuation
```

**Method 2: Scorecard Method**
```
Start: ₹5Cr median pre-seed valuation in India

Adjustments:
Team strength:        +20% (IIT founders)
Product:             +15% (strong traction)
Market size:         +25% (large TAM)
Competition:         -5% (crowded space)
Traction:            +30% (₹10L MRR)

Total adjustment: +85%

Valuation: ₹5Cr × 1.85 = ₹9.25 Cr (round to ₹10Cr)
```

#### Advanced Cap Table Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Clean Seed Round**
```
PRE-MONEY VALUATION: ₹8 Crore
INVESTMENT: ₹2 Crore
POST-MONEY: ₹10 Crore

| Shareholder | Pre-Money Shares | Price/Share | Investment | Post-Money Shares | % |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|---|
| Founder A | 400,000 | ₹20 | - | 400,000 | 40% |
| Founder B | 300,000 | ₹20 | - | 300,000 | 30% |

| **TOTAL** | **800,000** | | **₹2 Cr** | **1,000,000** | **100%** |

Founder A dilution: 50% → 40% (20% dilution)
Price per share jump: ₹20 → ₹100 (5x increase!)
```

**Scenario 2: With SAFE Note Conversion**
```
SAFE Note details:
- Amount: ₹50 Lakhs
- Discount: 20%
- Cap: ₹6 Crore

Seed round at ₹10Cr valuation:
- SAFE converts at lower of:
  * ₹10Cr × 80% = ₹8Cr (with discount)

SAFE investor gets:
₹50L / (₹6Cr / 1M shares) = 83,333 shares = 8.33%

### 28.4 Decision Frameworks

#### Framework 1: Should I PIVOT or PERSEVERE?

**Use this after 3-6 months if growth is slow**

Ask yourself:

| Question | PIVOT if... | PERSEVERE if... |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Product-Market Fit** | <30% retention, NPS <20 | >40% retention, NPS >40 |
| **Willing to Pay** | <40% said yes | >60% said yes |
| **Growth** | <5% MoM for 3 months | >10% MoM |
| **Market Size** | TAM <$100M | TAM >$1B |
| **Passion** | You're bored/unmotivated | You're excited, believe in it |
| **Runway** | <3 months, can't raise | >6 months OR can raise |

**Decision:** 4+ in PIVOT column → **Pivot** (change problem, customer, or approach)  
4+ in PERSEVERE column → **Keep going** (fix execution, not idea)

#### Framework 2: Should I FUNDRAISE or BOOTSTRAP?

| Factor | Fundraise if... | Bootstrap if... |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Growth Rate** | Can deploy capital for 3x growth | Growing steadily, profitable path visible |
| **Market** | Winner-take-most market | Service/niche market |
| **Competition** | Well-funded competitors | No major fundraising in market |
| **Runway** | <6 months, need capital | >12 months OR profitable |
| **Dilution Comfort** | OK giving up 20-25% | Want to keep ownership |
| **Investor Value** | Need connections, credibility | Have network already |

**Decision:** Both are valid. Fundraise to accelerate, bootstrap for freedom.

#### Framework 3: Should I hire EMPLOYEE or CONTRACTOR?

| Need | Employee (₹60-80K/month) | Contractor (₹500-2K/hour) |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Duration** | 12+ months work | Project-based, <3 months |
| **Control** | Need daily collaboration | Output-focused |
| **Skills** | Core to business (engineering, product) | Specialized (design, content) |
| **Budget** | Funded OR ₹5L+ MRR | Bootstrapped, low burn |
| **Compliance** | OK with EPF/ESI if 10-20 employees | Avoid compliance |

**Decision:** Hire employees for core team, contractors for specialized/short-term needs.

#### Framework 4: Should I build feature X?

Use RICE prioritization:

```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: How many users will this affect? (1-1000+)
Impact: How much will it improve their experience? (0.25=low, 3=massive)
Confidence: How sure are you? (50-100%)
Effort: How many person-weeks? (1-20+)

Example:
Feature: Mobile app
Reach: 500 users (50% of base)
Impact: 2 (high - they keep asking)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 8 weeks

Score = (500 × 2 × 0.8) / 8 = 100

Build features with highest RICE scores first.
```

#### Framework 5: Which MARKET to expand to next?

Score each market (1-10):

| Market | Market Size | Competition | Ease of Entry | Cultural Fit | Total | Rank |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------|------|
| USA 🇺🇸 | 10 | 8 (high) | 9 (English) | 9 | 36 | 1st |
| UK 🇬🇧 | 7 | 7 | 10 (English) | 9 | 33 | 2nd |
| SEA 🌏 | 6 | 5 | 7 | 8 | 26 | 3rd |
| Europe 🇪🇺 | 8 | 7 | 6 (languages) | 7 | 28 | - |

Start with highest total score.

```
As a [type of user],
I want [some goal]
so that [some reason/benefit]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected outcome]
```

**Examples:**
- As a project manager, I want to assign tasks to team members so that work is distributed evenly
- As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if forgotten

#### Sprint Board Example

| Backlog | To Do | In Progress | In Review | Done |

### 22.4 Exit Strategies

#### Why Think About Exits Early?

- Influences company structure (Pvt Ltd vs LLP)
- Affects investor decisions
- Shapes strategic decisions
- Helps set long-term goals

#### Exit Option 1: Acquisition

**What:** Another company buys your startup

**Typical Scenarios:**
- **Acqui-hire:** They want your team (₹5L-₹25L)
- **Product acquisition:** They want your technology (₹25L-₹2.5Cr)
- **Strategic acquisition:** Market consolidation (₹2.5Cr+)

**Acquisition Multiples:**
- **SaaS:** 5-15x ARR (revenue)
- **Marketplaces:** 1-3x GMV (transaction volume)
- **E-commerce:** 3-5x EBITDA (profit)

**Who Acquires Indian Startups:**
- **Tech Giants:** Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon
- **Indian Companies:** Tata, Reliance, Infosys, Wipro
- **Private Equity:** Sequoia, Tiger Global, SoftBank
- **Strategic Buyers:** Competitors in your space

**Timeline:** 6-12 months from first talk to close

**Founder Outcome:**
- Cash payout (70-80% at close, rest over 1-2 years)
- Employment contract (1-3 years typical)
- Vesting acceleration (negotiate!)
- Earnouts (additional payment if you hit targets)

**Indian Examples:**
- **Flipkart:** Acquired by Walmart for $16B (2018)
- **Paytm:** Acquired by Alibaba for $10B+ (majority stake)
- **Ola:** SoftBank investment, potential IPO
- **Delhivery:** Tatacapital investment $770M (2021)

#### Exit Option 2: IPO (Initial Public Offering)

**What:** Sell shares to the public on NSE/BSE

**Requirements:**
- ₹500Cr+ revenue typically
- Profitable or clear path to profitability
- Strong growth (30%+ YoY)
- Large market opportunity
- ₹2,500Cr+ valuation

**Process:**
- Hire investment banks (underwriters)
- 6-12 month preparation
- File DRHP with SEBI
- Roadshow (pitch to institutional investors)
- Pricing and listing

**Founder Outcome:**
- Sell some shares at IPO (typically 10-20%)
- Subject to lockup period (90-180 days)
- Ongoing shares vest over time
- Still run company (now with public company responsibilities)

**Indian Examples:**
- **Zomato:** IPO at ₹9,375Cr valuation (2021)
- **Nykaa:** IPO at ₹5,000Cr+ valuation (2021)
- **PolicyBazaar:** IPO at ₹3,500Cr valuation (2021)

**Pros:** Massive potential value, liquidity for shares, currency for M&A
**Cons:** Quarterly earnings pressure, loss of privacy, regulatory compliance costs

#### Exit Option 3: Stay Private / Bootstrap to Profitability

**What:** Don't sell, build a profitable business

**Models:**
- **Lifestyle business:** ₹5L-₹50L revenue, mostly bootstrapped
- **Private equity:** Sell majority to PE firm, stay on
- **Permanent hold:** Build generational business

**Founder Outcome:**
- Dividends / profit distributions
- Full control
- Build at own pace
- Potential sale later at higher value

**Examples:**
- **Basecamp:** Profitable, never raised VC
- **Atlassian:** Bootstrapped to IPO
- **Indian Examples:** Many service businesses, local SaaS companies

**Pros:** No investor pressure, keep equity, build sustainably
**Cons:** Slower growth, personal financial risk

#### Exit Option 4: Aquihire (Talent Acquisition)

**What:** Company buys you primarily for the team, not product

**When This Happens:**
- Product isn't working but team is strong
- Company wants to enter your space quickly
- Alternative to shutting down

**Typical Value:** ₹5L-₹25L total (~₹1L-₹2L per key person)

**Founder Outcome:**
- Some cash (often <₹1L)
- Stock in acquiring company
- Employment contract (2-4 years)
- Earn-out based on retention

#### Exit Option 5: Shut Down

**When:** No product-market fit after years, running out of money, founders burned out

**How to Shut Down Properly:**
1. **Be transparent** with team, investors, customers
2. **Give notice:** 30-60 days to customers
3. **Return money** if any left (investors get liquidation preference)
4. **Help employees land** new jobs
5. **Wind down legally** (file dissolution with MCA)
6. **Shut down accounts** (AWS, Razorpay, etc.)
7. **Data deletion** (give customers their data)

**Emotional Reality:**
- Failure is common (90% of startups fail)
- Not end of career - many successful founders failed first
- Investors understand (it's part of the game)
- Learn, reflect, move forward
