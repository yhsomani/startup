- Legal due diligence checklist:
  * Clean cap table
  * All IP assigned
  * No pending lawsuits
  * Compliant with labor laws
  * GST/Tax filings up to date

**3. Detailed Valuation Methods for India**

**Method 1: Comparable Company Analysis**
```
Find 3 Indian SaaS companies at similar stage:
- Company A: ₹2Cr ARR, valued at ₹20Cr (10x ARR)
- Company B: ₹1.5Cr ARR, valued at ₹12Cr (8x ARR)
- Company C: ₹2.5Cr ARR, valued at ₹30Cr (12x ARR)

Average multiple: 10x ARR

Your company: ₹1Cr ARR × 10x = ₹10Cr pre-money valuation
```

**Method 2: Scorecard Method**
```
Start: ₹5Cr median pre-seed valuation in India

Adjustments:
Team strength:        +20% (IIT founders)
Product:             +15% (strong traction)
Market size:         +25% (large TAM)
Competition:         -5% (crowded space)
Traction:            +30% (₹10L MRR)

Total adjustment: +85%

Valuation: ₹5Cr × 1.85 = ₹9.25 Cr (round to ₹10Cr)
```

**4. Advanced Cap Table Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Clean Seed Round**
```
PRE-MONEY VALUATION: ₹8 Crore
INVESTMENT: ₹2 Crore
POST-MONEY: ₹10 Crore

| Shareholder | Pre-Money Shares | Price/Share | Investment | Post-Money Shares | % |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|---|
| Founder A | 400,000 | ₹20 | - | 400,000 | 40% |
| Founder B | 300,000 | ₹20 | - | 300,000 | 30% |
| ESOP Pool | 100,000 | - | - | 100,000 | 10% |
| Seed Investor | 200,000 | ₹100 | ₹2,00,00,000 | 200,000 | 20% |
| **TOTAL** | **800,000** | | **₹2 Cr** | **1,000,000** | **100%** |

Founder A dilution: 50% → 40% (20% dilution)
Price per share jump: ₹20 → ₹100 (5x increase!)
```

**Scenario 2: With SAFE Note Conversion**
```
SAFE Note details:
- Amount: ₹50 Lakhs
- Discount: 20%
- Cap: ₹6 Crore

Seed round at ₹10Cr valuation:
- SAFE converts at lower of:
  * ₹10Cr × 80% = ₹8Cr (with discount)
  * ₹6Cr (cap) ✓ Better!
  
SAFE investor gets:
₹50L / (₹6Cr / 1M shares) = 83,333 shares = 8.33%

Dilution is HIGHER than expected!
