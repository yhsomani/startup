**Sources:** Personal pain point | Industry experience | Market gaps | Technology enablement | Regulatory changes

### Validation Process (8 Weeks)

**Weeks 1-2: Customer Discovery**
- Identify 100 potential customers (LinkedIn, Reddit, communities)
- Conduct 50+ interviews (30-min each)
- Script: "What's your biggest challenge with [problem]?" → "How do you solve it today?" → "Would you pay $X monthly for a solution?"
- **Success:** 60%+ say "yes, I'd pay"

**Weeks 3-4: Market Research**
- Calculate TAM/SAM/SOM (Total/Serviceable/Obtainable Market in $ and ₹)
- Example: Project Management SaaS
  - Global TAM: $50B | SAM: $5B (SMBs) | Year 1 SOM: $175K
  - India TAM: ₹2,000Cr | SAM: ₹500Cr | Year 1 SOM: ₹1.45Cr
- Identify 10 competitors (3 direct, 7 indirect)
- SWOT analysis: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

**Weeks 5-6: MVP Planning**
- Define: Minimum Viable Product (simplest version that delivers core value)

## 3. MARKET & COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

### Customer Segmentation
**Primary Persona (Global):**

- Behavior: Mobile-first, cloud-native, wants instant value

**Secondary Persona (India):**
- Similar but budget ₹500-5,000/month, prefers WhatsApp support, UPI payment

### Competitive Positioning
| Factor | Global Incumbents | Your Startup |

| Mobile | Adequate | Mobile-first |
| Target | Enterprise | SMB/Mid-market |

**Positioning Statement:** "Affordable, simple, mobile-first [category] for growing businesses"

### Market Size Calculation
```
TAM = Total customers × Average spend
SAM = TAM × % you can realistically serve
SOM = SAM × % you can capture in Year 1-3 (typically 0.01-0.1%)

Example:
TAM: 10M small businesses × $500/year = $5B
SAM: 1M (willing to switch) × $500 = $500M
SOM Year 1: 500 customers × $350 = $175K

## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT & QUALITY

### Risk Categories

**Product Risk:**
- No PMF → Validate with 50+ customers before building
- Poor UX → 10+ user tests
- Technical debt → Allocate 20% sprint capacity for refactoring

**Market Risk:**
- Competition → Differentiate (cheaper, simpler, faster)
- TAM too small → Validate $1B+ TAM
- Wrong ICP → Customer development interviews

**Financial Risk:**
- Burn too fast → Monitor weekly, cut if <6 months runway
- Over-hiring → Hire only when revenue supports 12 months salary
- No PMF before scaling → Validate before Series A

**Team Risk:**
- Co-founder conflict → Written agreement, vesting
- Key person → Document everything, cross-train
- Culture mismatch → Define values early, hire for fit

**Legal/Compliance:**
- IP infringement → Search trademarks, patents before naming
- Tax penalties → Hire CA (₹5-15K/month), file on time
- GDPR violation → Privacy lawyer consultation ($500-2K)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diversify: Multiple customer segments, geographies, channels
- Maintain runway: 12+ months cash always
- Insurance: General liability (₹30-50K/year), D&O (if VC-backed)
- Legal: CA retainer, lawyer on-call

---

## 13. SCALING & EXIT

### Scaling Triggers
**When to scale (Series A, hire aggressively):**
- ✅ PMF validated (NPS >50, retention >90%)
- ✅ Unit economics work (LTV:CAC >3, payback <12 months)
- ✅ Repeatable channel (know how to acquire customers profitably)
- ✅ Funding secured (12-18 months runway)

**How to scale:**
- **Team:** Hire ahead of demand (3-6 months lead time)
- **Marketing:** 10x spend on working channels
- **Product:** Expand features for upsell/cross-sell
- **Geography:** USA → UK/EU → SEA → RoW

**Red Flags (Don't scale):**
- Churn >10% monthly
- Negative NPS
- CAC > LTV
- No clear PMF

### International Expansion

**Market Priority:**
1. **USA** 🇺🇸 (Year 2): Largest TAM, English-speaking | Channels: ProductHunt, Google Ads, SEO
2. **UK/Europe** 🇬🇧🇪🇺 (Year 2-3): Similar to US, GDPR required
3. **Southeast Asia** 🌏 (Year 3): Price-sensitive, growing

**Localization:**
- Multi-currency (USD, EUR, GBP, INR)
- Multi-language (English priority, others Phase 2)
- Local payment methods (Stripe covers most)
- Timezone support in product

**US Entity (Optional, Year 2+):**
- When: Raising from US VCs OR >$1M ARR OR planning NASDAQ IPO
- Structure: US C-Corp (parent) owns India Pvt Ltd (subsidiary) OR vice versa
- Cost: $500-2K setup (Delaware), $5-10K annual compliance

### Exit Strategies

**Option 1: Acquisition**
- Timeline: Year 5-7
- Valuation: 5-10x ARR (typical for SaaS)
- Example: $10M ARR × 7x = $70M exit
- Buyers: Larger SaaS, PE firms, strategics
- Process: 6-12 months (LOI → Due diligence → Close)

**Option 2: IPO**
- Timeline: Year 7-10
- Requirements: $100M+ ARR, profitability, growth
- Examples: Freshworks (NASDAQ), Zomato (NSE)
- Process: 12-24 months (audit, roadshow, listing)

**Option 3: Bootstrap to Profitability**
- No exit, build sustainable business (Zoho model)
- Dividends, no investors/board pressure
- Freedom to experiment

**Option 4: Acqui-hire**
- If PMF fails but team is strong
- Valuation: $500K-2M (mostly founder payout)
