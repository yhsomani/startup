### 9.3 Pricing Psychology

**Global Pricing:**
- Free tier (5 users, basic features) → Land
- $29/month Starter (25 users, standard) → MOST POPULAR
- $79/month Pro (unlimited, advanced) → High-value customers
- $299/month Enterprise (custom, SLA) → Large orgs

**Why These Numbers:**
- $29: Affordable, impulse purchase (no manager approval needed)
- $79: 3-5 person team can afford, serious businesses
- $299: Enterprise budget, signals premium

**Annual Discount:** 20% (= 2 months free)
- $29/month = $348/year → Offer $279 (save $69)
- Upfront cash, lower churn

**India Pricing (70% cheaper):**
- ₹699 ($8.40) vs Global $29 → Adjusted for PPP
- Still profitable (India costs 3x lower)

# PART 4: SCALING

## 10. TECHNOLOGY & INFRASTRUCTURE

### 10.1 Architecture (Global Scale)

**Multi-Region Setup:**
```
[Users Worldwide]
        ↓
[CloudFlare CDN] ← Static assets, DDoS protection
        ↓
[AWS Load Balancer]
        ↓
  ┌─────┴─────┐
Mumbai        US-East (if >50% US users)
  ↓             ↓
[App Servers]   [App Servers]
  ↓             ↓
[RDS Multi-AZ]  [Read Replica]
  ↓
[ElastiCache Redis] ← Session, cache
```

**Database Strategy:**
- Write: Primary (Mumbai)
- Read: Replicas (Mumbai + US-East)
- Latency: <100ms globally (with CDN)

**Scaling Path:**
```
0-1K users: Single Mumbai t3.medium ($30/month)
1K-10K: 2x t3.large ($140/month) + RDS db.t3.medium ($60/month)
10K-100K: Auto-scaling 3-10x instances + bigger RDS
100K+: Multi-region, microservices
```

### 10.2 Security

**SSL/TLS:**
- Cloudflare (free SSL)
- Let's Encrypt (backup)

**Authentication:**
- Password: bcrypt hashing
- MFA: Optional for users, mandatory for team
- OAuth: Google, GitHub login

**Data Protection:**
- Encryption at rest (AWS RDS default)
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS only)
- Backup: Daily automated (30-day retention)

**Compliance:**
- GDPR: Privacy policy, data export/delete
- SOC 2 (Year 2 for enterprise): $20-50K audit

**Vulnerability:**
- Dependency scanning (GitHub Dependabot)
- Penetration testing (annually, ₹50K-2L)

---

## 11. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION

### 11.1 Market Entry Priority

**Year 1: India**

**Year 2-3: UK/Europe 🇬🇧🇪🇺**
- Similar to US, English-speaking
- GDPR compliance required
- Goal: 500 customers, $15K MRR

**Year 3: Southeast Asia 🌏**
- Price-sensitive (like India)
- Growing startup ecosystem
- Goal: 300 customers, $10K MRR

**Structure:**
```
Option A: India Parent
India Pvt Ltd (Parent)
    ↓ owns 100%
US C-Corp (Subsidiary) ← Sales, marketing

## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

### 12.1 Common Risks

**Product Risk:**
- No product-market fit → Validate with 50+ customers before building
- Bad UX → User testing (10 users minimum)
- Too many features → Start with MVP (20% features, 80% value)

**Market Risk:**
- Competition → Differentiate (cheaper, simpler, faster)
- Market too small → TAM >$1B
- Wrong target customer → ICP research

**Execution Risk:**
- Co-founder conflict → Written founder agreement, vesting
- Key person dependency → Document everything, cross-training
- Missed deadlines → Agile sprints, buffer

**Financial Risk:**
- Runout of cash → Fundraise with 6+ months runway left
- Burn too fast → Monitor monthly burn, cut early
- Over-hiring → Hire when revenue supports (cover 12 months salary)

**Legal/Compliance Risk:**
- IP issues → IP assignment from Day 1
- Tax penalties → Hire CA, file on time
- GDPR violations → Privacy lawyer consultation

### 12.2 Mitigation Strategies

**Diversify Revenue:**
- Multiple customer segments (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
- Multiple geographies (India, US, Europe)
- Multiple plans (starter, pro, enterprise)

**Maintain Runway:**
- 12+ months cash minimum
- If <6 months, pause hiring, reduce burn

**Build Defensibility:**
- Network effects (harder to leave when whole team uses it)
- Data moat (insights improve with usage)
- Brand (known as "the [category] tool")
- Integrations (locked into ecosystem)

## APPENDIX: KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

**Unit Economics:**
```
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) = Total Revenue / Total Customers
Churn Rate = Customers Lost / Total Customers (at period start)
LTV (Lifetime Value) = ARPU / Churn Rate × Gross Margin %
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) = (Sales + Marketing) / New Customers
Payback Period = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)
LTV:CAC Ratio = LTV / CAC (Target: >3:1)
```

**SaaS Metrics:**
```
MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) = Sum of all monthly subscriptions
ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) = MRR × 12
Gross Churn = MRR lost from cancellations / Total MRR
Net Churn = (MRR lost - MRR gained from expansion) / Total MRR
Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New MRR (Target: <1.5)
Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth % + Profit Margin % (Target: >40)
```

**Financial Projections:**
```
Current MRR × (1 + Monthly Growth Rate)^Months = Future MRR
Example: ₹5L MRR growing 10% monthly = ₹5L × (1.10)^12 = ₹15.7L in 12 months
```
