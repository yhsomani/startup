Questions:
1. "Tell me about how you currently handle [problem area]"

  ```
  Businesses likely to switch: 10 million (10% of TAM)
  × $500/year
  = $5 billion SAM
  ```

  ```
  ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): $29
  Churn (monthly): 5% (assumption)
  Lifetime (months): 1/0.05 = 20 months
  LTV (Lifetime Value): $29 × 20 × 80% margin = $464
  
  CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): Target <$150
  LTV:CAC Ratio: $464/$150 = 3.1:1 ✅ (good if >3)
  ```

**Afternoon (1 hour):**
- [ ] Create simple financial model (Google Sheets):
  ```
  Month | Customers | MRR | Costs | Profit
  1     | 10        | $290| $5,000| ($4,710)
