## SECTION 4: DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### Framework 1: Should I PIVOT or PERSEVERE?

**Use this after 3-6 months if growth is slow**

Ask yourself:

| Question | PIVOT if... | PERSEVERE if... |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Product-Market Fit** | <30% retention, NPS <20 | >40% retention, NPS >40 |
| **Willing to Pay** | <40% said yes | >60% said yes |
| **Growth** | <5% MoM for 3 months | >10% MoM |
| **Market Size** | TAM <$100M | TAM >$1B |
| **Passion** | You're bored/unmotivated | You're excited, believe in it |
| **Runway** | <3 months, can't raise | >6 months OR can raise |

**Decision:**
- 4+ in PIVOT column → **Pivot** (change problem, customer, or approach)
- 4+ in PERSEVERE column → **Keep going** (fix execution, not idea)

---

### Framework 2: Should I FUNDRAISE or BOOTSTRAP?

| Factor | Fundraise if... | Bootstrap if... |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Growth Rate** | Can deploy capital for 3x growth | Growing steadily, profitable path visible |
| **Market** | Winner-take-most market | Service/niche market |
| **Competition** | Well-funded competitors | No major fundraising in market |
| **Runway** | <6 months, need capital | >12 months OR profitable |
| **Dilution Comfort** | OK giving up 20-25% | Want to keep ownership |
| **Investor Value** | Need connections, credibility | Have network already |

**Decision:** Both are valid. Fundraise to accelerate, bootstrap for freedom.

---

### Framework 3: Should I hire EMPLOYEE or CONTRACTOR?

| Need | Employee (₹60-80K/month) | Contractor (₹500-2K/hour) |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Duration** | 12+ months work | Project-based, <3 months |
| **Control** | Need daily collaboration | Output-focused |
| **Skills** | Core to business (engineering, product) | Specialized (design, content) |
| **Budget** | Funded OR ₹5L+ MRR | Bootstrapped, low burn |
| **Compliance** | OK with EPF/ESI if 10-20 employees | Avoid compliance |

**Decision:** Hire employees for core team, contractors for specialized/short-term needs.

---

### Framework 4: Should I build feature X?

Use RICE prioritization:

```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: How many users will this affect? (1-1000+)
Impact: How much will it improve their experience? (0.25=low, 3=massive)
Confidence: How sure are you? (50-100%)
Effort: How many person-weeks? (1-20+)

Example:
Feature: Mobile app
Reach: 500 users (50% of base)
Impact: 2 (high - they keep asking)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 8 weeks

Score = (500 × 2 × 0.8) / 8 = 100

Build features with highest RICE scores first.
```

---

### Framework 5: Which MARKET to expand to next?

Score each market (1-10):

| Market | Market Size | Competition | Ease of Entry | Cultural Fit | Total | Rank |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------|------|
| USA 🇺🇸 | 10 | 8 (high) | 9 (English) | 9 | 36 | 1st |
| UK 🇬🇧 | 7 | 7 | 10 (English) | 9 | 33 | 2nd |
| SEA 🌏 | 6 | 5 | 7 | 8 | 26 | 3rd |
| Europe 🇪🇺 | 8 | 7 | 6 (languages) | 7 | 28 | - |

Start with highest total score.
